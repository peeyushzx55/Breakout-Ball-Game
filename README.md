# Breakout-Ball-Game
A Java GUI Application which implements the Breakout Ball Game.
In this game we have a ball and specified number of bricks. The task is to break all the bricks in order to win the game.
The bal will continuously bounce on the scroller present at the bottom and we have to move the scroller so that the ball can again touch down the scroller and again bounce back to break the bricks...
If we are not able to save the ball and it falls down then we loose our game.
